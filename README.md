To run everything locally (requires Node and MySQL): Run '402tables2.txt' in a local MySQL database and change 'server.js' under "DB CONFIG" accordingly. Start your database server (in command prompt) with "mysqld" and run the Node server with "node server" (make sure you're in the directory containing 'server.js'). Navigate to localhost:3000 (or change the port in 'server.js' under "SERVER").
